# Automotive Front Hood Panel Design

This project focuses on the design and development of an *automotive front hood panel* using CATIA V5 R30. Starting from a provided Class-A surface, the design process incorporates key engineering considerations like safety, manufacturability, pedestrian protection, and OEM benchmarking.

## Overview

- *CAD Tool*: CATIA V5 R30
- *Design Inputs*: Class-A Surface
- *Scope*:
  - Surface modeling (Class B & C)
  - Hood inner panel design with reinforcements
  - Hinge and latch layout
  - Hemming and manufacturing considerations
  - Pedestrian safety and force dissipation zones

## Design Workflow

1. Interpret Class-A surface
2. Create Class-B and Class-C surfaces
3. Design hood inner panel with ribs and embosses
4. Integrate hinge and latch layout
5. Apply hemming features and hem reliefs
6. Evaluate force flow and safety under impact
7. Final CAD validation and documentation

## Key Considerations

- Structural stiffness and durability
- BIW compatibility
- Pedestrian impact performance
- Tooling feasibility and manufacturability
