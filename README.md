# DEVELOPMENT-OF-AUTOMOTIVE-FRONT-HOOD-PANEL
Development of Automotive Front Hood Panel
This project involves the end-to-end design and development of an automotive front hood panel, starting from a Class-A surface. The aim was to create a structurally sound, manufacturable, and aesthetically appealing hood panel aligned with automotive industry standards.

**Key Highlights**:
**CAD Modeling using CATIA V5 R30** – developed both Class-B and Class-C surfaces from the given Class-A surface ensuring manufacturability with proper draft angles, G1/G2 continuity, and tooling feasibility.

**Hinge & Latch Integration** – designed hood articulation mechanisms with proper load path management, considering packaging space and safety standards.

**Structural Reinforcement** – modeled the inner panel with stiffness beads and emboss features to meet durability and pedestrian safety norms.

**BIW (Body-in-White) Considerations** – ensured design compatibility with BIW mounting points, aligning with crashworthiness and rigidity requirements.

**Benchmarking –** referenced OEM layout practices and existing vehicle models to validate hood opening kinematics and part alignment.

This project demonstrates proficiency in sheet metal design, surface modeling, automotive packaging, and product development methodology.
